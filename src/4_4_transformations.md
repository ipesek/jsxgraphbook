## Transformations

In JSXGraph it is possible to apply a plane projective transformation to elements using a 3x3 matrix to define the specific transformation. To make life easier
JSXGraph has some standard trasformation predefined. Some of those are:
- Translation
- Scaling
- Rotation

Translation moves the selected object in the given direction. Scaling increases or decreases the size of our object and rotation rotates it. We will
demonstrate their uses on the next example.
