**Harmonic conjugate points.** Given three collinear points *A*, *B* and *C*; *C* being outside the line segment *AB*.
Determine the point *D* of the segment *AB* so that the ratio of its distances to *A* and *B*, respectively, is equal to the 
ration of distances of the point *C* to points *A* and *B*, respectively, i.e. *\|AD\|\/\|BD\|=\|AC\|\/\|BC\|*. 

This point *D* is called the *harmonic conjugate of C with respect to A and B* and points *A*, *B*, *C* and *D* together 
form the so called *harmonic quadruple*.
