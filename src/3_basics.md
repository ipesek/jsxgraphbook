## Basics
JSXGraph construction is composed from:
* drawing board
* objects (points, lines, etc.)
* relations between objects (optional, if we want some dynamics in the construction)
* events (optional, if we want some additional actions to be triggered)


In this section we will cover how to create drawing board, objects and use them to construct some simple examples.
